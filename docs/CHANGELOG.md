## [3.0.0] - Unbounded Self-Improvement - 2025-10-30

### Major Features

#### Unbounded Primitive Synthesis
- **SynthesizedPrimitive**: Generates new comparison operators from QK^T rules
  - Extracts comparison logic via SVD from successful architectures
  - Learns threshold and bias parameters for novel operators
  - True unbounded search space - mutation pool grows infinitely
- **Automatic Rule Extraction**: Harvests QK^T bottleneck from top-5 architectures every 50 generations
- **Dynamic Mutation Pool**: Base 15 + discovered + synthesized (15 â†’ 18 â†’ 21 â†’ ...)

#### True Self-Improvement
- System generates its own primitives from extracted comparison rules
- Everything reduces to comparison operators (< = >)
- Corrupt architectures automatically filtered by evolution
- Implements mathematician choosing between comparison ranges

### Added
- `SynthesizedPrimitive` class: Novel comparison operators with learned thresholds
- `synthesize_primitives_from_rules()`: Generates new mutations from extracted QK^T rules
- `extract_and_generate_primitives()`: Periodic rule extraction and synthesis
- Dynamic mutation tracking: `_synthesized_primitives` list grows during search
- Synthesis logging: Reports new primitives with effective rank

### Changed
- Updated README for v3.0.0 with unbounded synthesis documentation
- Removed emoji from all output
- Simplified installation instructions
- Mutation pool now grows dynamically during search
- Primitive synthesis interval: 50 generations (configurable)

### Performance
- Unbounded search space through automatic primitive generation
- No fixed primitive set - system creates new operators indefinitely
- Maintains 93%+ cache efficiency with growing operator pool
